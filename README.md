# Rocketair Clone

This task is a clone of two pages of the rocketair website. The goal of this task was to replicate the design and functionality as closely as possible using modern web development techniques.

Technologies Used :

    React.js – Used to build the component-based UI.
    CSS – Styled the pages to match the original website.
    Framer Motion – Implemented smooth animations for text appearance.

Features Implemented:

    Page 1
        Responsive layout for different screen sizes.

        Interactive elements styled with hover effects.


    Page 2
        Scroll-triggered animations where text appears line by line as the user scrolls.

        Optimized media queries to disable hover effects on mobile screens.

        Proper component structure and reusable styling.
